# BKT Advisory Agentic Release Plan

## Purpose

This document is the control-plane source of truth for the BKT Advisory website launch project. It defines the delivery sequence, agent operating standards, role assignments, testing requirements, and release gates for work scoped to the following repositories:

- `jburkhardt4/BKT-Advisory`
- `jburkhardt4/Bktadvisoryprojectestimator`

This version formally retires the Figma Make agent from the active workflow. Phase 1 design-system alignment, theme parity, visual QA, and mobile UX auditing now belong to the GitHub code agents working directly in the codebase and preview environments.

## Operating Model

### Live control-plane documents

The release workflow must stay anchored to these three live orchestration files:

- `jburkhardt4/BKT-Advisory/docs/orchestration/agentic-release-plan.md`
- `jburkhardt4/BKT-Advisory/docs/orchestration/prompt-library.md`
- `jburkhardt4/Bktadvisoryprojectestimator/docs/orchestration/estimator-execution-constraints.md`

Usage rules:

- read the applicable control-plane documents before acting
- if a task touches estimator logic, estimator UI, or cross-repo workflow handoffs, also read the estimator constraints file before implementation
- do not create parallel orchestration docs or treat stale branches, closed PRs, or superseded agent outputs as instruction sources

### Workflow update

The active release workflow no longer includes a separate Figma Make or Figma-only design agent.

- Phase 1 design-system and mobile UX audit is owned by `Codex / Copilot / GitHub code agents`
- visual QA happens in the codebase, local preview, Codespaces, screenshots, visual diffs, and browser-based verification
- human-approved design references may still inform implementation, but they do not replace code-agent verification or act as an execution lane

### Daily command center

Use browser-based VS Code Codespaces as the primary operating environment.

- read and edit both repositories from Codespaces when both are mounted
- launch agent work from Codespaces using the prompt library
- review branches, PRs, screenshots, diffs, and validation evidence in GitHub
- make final merge and release decisions through the human review loop

### Coordination rule

Agents do not silently coordinate in the background. Coordination happens through shared artifacts.

The communication path is:

1. JB defines priority and scope.
2. Agents read the same orchestration documents.
3. Agents publish work through GitHub artifacts, preview evidence, or environment-specific outputs.
4. JB reviews conflicts, gaps, and blockers.
5. JB approves implementation, merge, and release.

## Repositories in Scope

### `jburkhardt4/BKT-Advisory`

Primary responsibility:

- marketing site
- admin portal
- client portal
- project dashboard
- authentication and protected routing
- cross-application orchestration and release governance

### `jburkhardt4/Bktadvisoryprojectestimator`

Primary responsibility:

- estimator-specific UX and state handling

- quote output and estimator-side validation requirements
- data handoff requirements that support quote-to-project automation

## Delivery Sequence

Execute work in this order to reduce rework and prevent scope drift.

### Phase 1 - Design system and mobile UX audit

Primary owner:

- `Codex / Copilot / GitHub code agents`

Goal:

- enforce shared design-system rules in code across the marketing site, admin portal, client portal, project dashboard, and estimator flows
- validate flawless light theme, dark theme, and system theme behavior
- audit recent UI changes from the last one to two weeks for mobile layout stability and visual consistency

Acceptance criteria:

- shared Tailwind tokens or equivalent shared theme tokens control color, spacing, typography, radius, and elevation on release-critical surfaces
- no hardcoded theme-breaking colors remain on critical flows
- component, state, and interaction styling are consistent across marketing, admin, client, dashboard, and estimator surfaces
- desktop and phone-size review is completed for key screens changed in the last one to two weeks
- token drift, contrast issues, spacing issues, and state inconsistencies are fixed or logged with evidence
- visual verification evidence exists for light, dark, and system theme behavior

### Phase 2 - Authentication and navigation integrity

Primary owner:

- `Codex / Copilot / GitHub code agents`

Goal:

## Required Operating Standard for Every Agent

1. Read the applicable control-plane documents before acting.
2. Convert rough prompts into a structured execution plan before doing work.
3. Do not assume setup is correct; verify.
4. Code agents own design-system enforcement, theme parity, and mobile QA inside the codebase.
5. Do not mark work complete without explicit visual and functional validation.
6. If tooling is missing, provide novice-friendly setup steps with exact labels and actions.
7. Propose two to three additional high-value improvements beyond the requested task.
8. Rank recommendations by impact, effort, risk, and release-readiness.
9. Minimize scope creep in active release work.
10. Surface blockers immediately.
11. Never ship unverified UI or workflow changes.

## Mandatory Testing Standard

Every task must include:

- what changed
- how it was tested visually
- how it was tested functionally
- what remains unverified
- what human action is still required, if any

### Standardized testing stack

1. Playwright for browser-based end-to-end testing
2. Visual snapshot testing or screenshot comparison for regressions
3. Preview-environment validation for meaningful changes
4. PR gate requiring visual and functional evidence
5. Theme, responsive, and token verification against the implemented design system and current orchestration requirements

### Minimum release gate

A change is not release-ready unless it has:

- visual verification
- functional verification
- mobile verification
- theme verification
- auth and routing verification where relevant
- explicit evidence attached to the branch, PR, issue, or review artifact

## Risks

- scope creep can delay release-critical work
- missing automated tests can allow regressions to compound
- hardcoded colors or one-off styling can break theme parity
- desktop-first changes can break mobile layouts
- external tool or credential dependencies can block verification
- stale outputs from deprecated agent workflows can create false signals if they are treated as current
- multi-agent divergence can create branch and merge chaos if artifacts are not centralized

## Chronological Rollout Guide

### Slot 1 - Establish control plane

- confirm repository scope
- treat the three live orchestration files as the control plane
- store this release plan in `BKT-Advisory`
- store the prompt library in `BKT-Advisory`
- store estimator-specific constraints in `Bktadvisoryprojectestimator`
- create GitHub issues or equivalent work items from the active priorities

### Slot 2 - Code-agent design-system and mobile audit

- assign Phase 1 to `Codex / Copilot / GitHub code agents`
- audit Tailwind tokens, typography, spacing, contrast, and component states
- validate light, dark, and system theme behavior through code and preview evidence
- review recent UI work on phone-size screens before additional UI churn continues
- fix or log drift before broader release work proceeds

### Slot 3 - Execute critical implementation and validation

- assign auth hardening
- assign quote-to-project hardening
- assign mobile hardening and regression cleanup
- assign automated QA setup
- require evidence on every implementation branch or PR

## Execution Notes

- this document is a control-plane artifact, not an auto-executing workflow
- prompts do not fan out automatically to agents
- agents do not automatically talk to one another unless a platform explicitly supports that behavior
- Figma Make is deprecated as an active workflow agent and must not be assigned Phase 1 ownership
- use this document to keep prompts, outputs, and validation aligned across environments
