# CLAUDE Phase 1 Audit — BKT Advisory

**Audit Date:** 2026-04-01  
**Auditor:** Claude Code (Sonnet 4.6)  
**Mode:** Read-only architecture audit — no code modified  
**Repositories:** BKT-Advisory (main site) + Bktadvisoryprojectestimator (estimator)

---

## 1. Phase 1 Executive Summary

Both repositories are largely launch-ready architecturally. The **BKT-Advisory** main site has a mature auth system (admin/client role guards, retry logic, metadata fallback), 42 Vitest unit tests, and a 6-phase orchestration plan. The **estimator** is a focused single-page application with AI-driven quote generation and a clean portal mapper layer for cross-repo handoff.

**Critical blockers before launch:**

- Estimator has zero automated tests and no `.env.example`
- Playwright E2E tests are required per orchestration plan but not yet configured in either repo
- Quote-to-project handoff automation is designed but not yet verified end-to-end
- Mobile verification has no automated coverage (visual regression or Playwright mobile viewports)

## 3. Architecture Map

### 3a. BKT-Advisory — Route Surface

```plaintext
Public (no auth):
  /           → HomePage
  /work       → WorkPage
  /services   → ServicesPage
  /process    → ProcessPage
  /about      → AboutPage
  /auth       → AuthPage (sign in / sign up)
  /estimator  → EstimatorBoundary → redirects to https://estimator.bktadvisory.com

Protected (RequireAuth):
  /portal     → PortalPage (client dashboard)

Admin-only (RequireAuth + AdminRoute):
  /portal/admin             → AdminDashboardPage
  /portal/admin/quotes      → AdminQuotesPage
  /portal/admin/projects    → AdminProjectsPage
  /portal/admin/activities  → AdminActivitiesPage
  /portal/admin/milestones  → AdminMilestonesPage
```

### 3b. BKT-Advisory — Auth Data Flow

```plaintext
App mount
  → supabase.auth.getSession()   [initializes AuthContext]
  → onAuthStateChange()           [subscribes to session changes]
  → fetchProfile() with retry     [3 attempts, 250ms interval]
    → Supabase profiles table
    → On failure: fallback to app_metadata.role / user_metadata.role
  → AuthContext provides: { session, loading, role }

Route guards:
  RequireAuth: !session → /auth (with state.from preserved)
  AdminRoute:  role !== 'admin' → /portal
```

### 3c. BKT-Advisory — Key Module Files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` | Session + role state, retry logic, SSO fallback |
| `src/components/RequireAuth.tsx` | Auth-only route guard |
| `src/components/AdminRoute.tsx` | Admin-role route guard |
| `src/routes.tsx` | Full route map |
| `src/supabase/client.ts` | Supabase client init (supports local/cloud env key variants) |
| `src/contexts/ThemeProvider.tsx` | next-themes wrapper, syncs `meta[theme-color]` |
| `src/contexts/PortalProfileContext.tsx` | Portal profile state (name, email, avatar, role) |
| `src/components/admin/adminCrmApi.ts` | Admin CRM API integration layer |
| `src/components/portal/portalData.ts` | Quote/Project/Milestone/Activity type definitions |
| `supabase/migrations/` | DB schema: ENUM types, RLS policies (915+ lines) |

### 3d. Estimator — Architecture

```plaintext
EstimatorAppShell (state root)
  ├── showQuote=false → Estimator (9-step form, file upload)
  │     └── AIChatbot (GPT-4 chat, autofill, scope refinement)
  │           └── Edge functions: /chat, /refine-scope, /analyze-document
  └── showQuote=true → Quote (PDF/DOCX generation, export)
        └── Edge function: /save-row (Google Sheets legacy integration)

Portal handoff layer (/src/portal/):
  mapQuoteDataToQuoteRecord()
  mapAcceptedQuoteToProjectRecord()
  → Consumed by BKT-Advisory portal on quote acceptance
```

### 3e. Cross-Repo Data Flow

```plaintext
Estimator:
  User fills 9 steps
  → calculateQuote() → QuoteData
  → mapQuoteDataToQuoteRecord() → QuoteRecord
  → Portal (BKT-Advisory) persists QuoteRecord to Supabase

Portal (BKT-Advisory):
  Admin reviews quotes
  → mark status = "accepted"
  → mapAcceptedQuoteToProjectRecord() → ProjectRecord
  → Admin creates project from quote
  → Client sees project in /portal dashboard
```

- [ ] `npm test` (vitest) passes all 42+ test files
- [ ] Playwright: sign in → `/portal` → project view (happy-path)
- [ ] Playwright: non-admin redirect from `/portal/admin`
- [ ] Visual screenshots: marketing home, portal, admin dashboard (light + dark)
- [ ] Mobile screenshots: 375px and 768px viewports

**Estimator:**

- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds
- [ ] Manual walkthrough: 9 steps → quote generated → PDF download
- [ ] Manual walkthrough: AI chatbot → autofill → verify form fields populated
- [ ] Visual screenshots: steps 1, 4, 7 (final quote) at mobile and desktop

## 7. Exact Next Action

### Immediate (Phase 1 completion)

1. Run `npm run typecheck && npm run build` in both repos — confirm no errors
2. Add Playwright to BKT-Advisory: `npm install -D @playwright/test && npx playwright install`
3. Write Playwright test: sign in → `/portal` happy path + admin redirect rejection
4. Create estimator portal mapper unit tests (vitest): `mapQuoteDataToQuoteRecord` + `mapAcceptedQuoteToProjectRecord`
5. Generate `.env.example` for both repos (placeholder values only)
6. Capture visual screenshots: marketing home, portal, admin dashboard, estimator steps 1/4/7 — light + dark mode

### Then Phase 2 (Auth + Navigation)

- Trace full sign-in flow: Supabase → AuthContext → RequireAuth → portal
- Verify sign-out clears session and redirects to `/`
- Test token refresh behavior (1-hour JWT expiry per `supabase/config.toml`)
- Verify SSO metadata fallback when `profiles` table is slow

---

## VERIFIED vs ASSUMED

### VERIFIED (observed directly in source)

- Auth guards exist in `RequireAuth.tsx` and `AdminRoute.tsx` with correct redirect logic
- Role resolution has 3-attempt retry with 250ms intervals and metadata fallback
- Supabase migrations include RLS policies for quotes, projects, profiles, avatars
- ThemeProvider uses `next-themes` with `attribute: "class"` and slate-950/slate-50 anchors
- EstimatorBoundary redirects to `https://estimator.bktadvisory.com` after 1 second
- Portal mapper layer (`/src/portal/`) is pure functions with no React/UI dependencies
- 42 Vitest test files exist covering auth, admin routes, theme, profile utils
- Estimator has zero test files of any kind
- Both repos share Supabase project `hjrvtzkktodoxigezxqy`
- Estimator uses Hono edge functions for 4 AI/integration endpoints
- Edge functions require `OPENAI_API_KEY` via `Deno.env.get()` (not committed to source)
- Both repos use Tailwind CSS v4.1.12 (zero-config, no `tailwind.config.ts`)
- Both repos output to `build/` via Vite
- Both dev servers configured for port 5000, host `0.0.0.0` (Codespaces-friendly)

### ASSUMED (inferred, not directly tested)

- The 42 Vitest tests currently pass (not executed in this pass)
- `npm run build` succeeds in both repos (not executed in this pass)
- Supabase RLS policies correctly restrict client access to own data (not query-tested)
- Portal QuoteRecord consumption in BKT-Advisory is wired up to the estimator mapper output (end-to-end not traced)
- Estimator is deployed to `https://estimator.bktadvisory.com` as a static SPA
- OpenAI API key is set in Supabase edge function secrets (not verified)
- Google Apps Script endpoint is accessible and correctly receives quote data
- All 50+ Radix UI component aliases in `vite.config.ts` are correctly resolving at build time

## DO NOT TOUCH YET

The following areas must not be modified until their Phase is active and release gate criteria are met:

| Area | Reason | Owner Phase |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` | Core auth logic — any change affects all protected routes | Phase 2 |
| `supabase/migrations/` | Schema changes require coordinated migration + RLS audit | Phase 2 / Phase 3 |
| `src/components/EstimatorBoundary.tsx` | Cross-repo redirect — requires validating estimator deployment URL | Phase 2 |
| Portal mapper layer (`/src/portal/`) in estimator | Integration contract — BKT-Advisory must update consumption code in sync | Phase 3 |
| Quote calculation logic in `Estimator.tsx` | Revenue-critical — requires manual quote verification test | Phase 3 |
| `supabase/functions/server/index.tsx` (estimator) | AI endpoint logic — requires functional validation of all 4 endpoints | Phase 3 |
| `src/components/admin/adminCrmApi.ts` | Untested CRM integration — needs RLS audit first | Phase 3 |
| `src/supabase/client.ts` | Client init affects all Supabase calls — touch only with full auth flow trace | Phase 2 |
| Google Apps Script integration URL | Hardcoded endpoint — rotation plan needed before any URL changes | Phase 3 |
| PDF.js CDN worker reference | CDN dependency — evaluate self-hosting before removing | Phase 4 |
